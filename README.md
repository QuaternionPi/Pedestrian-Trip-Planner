# Pedestrian Trip Planner

This is a Final Project for CMPT 353 at Simon Fraser University. It trains a Machine Learning model to create optimally nice pedestrian routes around The City of Vancouver.


## To run

First, download OpenStreetMap .zip file from <https://download.geofabrik.de/north-america/canada/british-columbia.html>
and unzip it to a folder.

Then, call the program by running

```console

python3 main.py <path-to-osm-unzipped>
```

The first run of the program will store approximately one gigabyte of data in a local cache.
