# Pedestrian Trip Planner

This is a final project for CMPT 353 Computational Data Science at Simon Fraser University. It creates optimally nice pedestrian routes around the City of Vancouver.

## To run

First, download OpenStreetMap .zip file from <https://download.geofabrik.de/north-america/canada/british-columbia.html> and unzip it to a folder.

Then, call the program by running

```console

python3 main.py <path-to-osm-unzipped>
```

The first run of the program will store approximately 3 MB of cache in the project directory.
